Lions eat their offsprings if they don&#8217;t have enough food, engage in violent territorial disputes and forcibly impregnate females. Dogs smell each others&#8217; backside when they first meet. Many animals even kill <a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/do-animals-murder-their-own-species">members of their own species</a>. If you say that animals doing something is a justification for us doing it, then by this logic you could advocate murder, infanticide, rape and several other unethical and/or disgusting behaviour that you don&#8217;t engage in.</p><p>Another crucial point is that animals in nature kill to survive. We don&#8217;t need to eat other animals to survive, and doing so causes suffering, so if we can avoid it, we should. Animals are not good ethical role models.</p>'

This is because they are continuously abused throughout their lives for their milk, and then<strong> </strong>killed. This is how the dairy industry works:</p><p>Since cows only produce milk when they&#8217;re pregnant, the process begins with forced artificial insemination of cows. The farmers insert their arms into the sexual orifice of the cows and pump bull semen into them to impregnate them. This is a necessary step for milk production and occurs in small family farms all the way to factory farms.</p><p>Once the cow has a baby, two things may happen. If the baby is male, then he is no use for the farmers since he will never produce milk. Therefore, the baby is either <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2152608/Baby-calves-shot-C4-documentary-People-right-complain-dont-inform-food.html">killed at the farm</a>, or sold to the veal industry for meat. If the baby is female, then she will have the same future as her mother and will go through several cycles of emotional and physical abuse. In both cases, the mother is not allowed to stay too long with her baby, and cows tend to cry for days after their baby is stolen.</p><p>After about two or three milking cycles, the cow&#8217;s milk production becomes unprofitable, so the cow is killed. At this stage the cow is usually six years old.

	answer :'<p>Most of the food humans eat is vegan. Fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta, bread, potatoes and soy. You enjoy these foods every day and you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re unpalatable. The food your prepare is as good as you make it. There are award winning vegan food products and restaurants all over the world. You can easily find online recipes to veganise your favourite meals. There are plenty of dairy milk alternatives in the market. If you don&#8217;t like soy milk, try oat, rice, coconut, hazelnut or almond milk.</p><p>And even if vegan food was tasteless, morality trumps personal pleasure. An animal&#8217;s desire to live will always be greater than your desire to eat a steak, and deep down you know this.</p>'

	answer :'<p>People are fast to use subjective morality to justify things they do when it&#8217;s convenient, but wouldn&#8217;t tolerate this argument if they were the victims. If I kill you, or your dog or a friend, by your logic this wouldn&#8217;t be unethical because in my subjective view of morality killing isn&#8217;t wrong. Morality must be based in facts and reason, it can&#8217;t be completely arbitrary, or else anyone can justify an atrocity by saying their morality is subjective. We must have at least some objective measurements of what is and isn&#8217;t ethical. Agreeing that killing beings for pleasure or convenience isn&#8217;t ethical is a good place to start to prevent violence towards humans and animals. Veganism follows from this.</p><p>Even if you believe morality is subjective, I think most people would agree that animals have some moral value, and that they shouldn&#8217;t be harmed for no reason. So by your own subjective morality you can agree that veganism is right because harming animals unnecessarily is wrong.</p>'

	argument: "Focus on more important issues / Human rights are more important",
	tldr: "",
	answer :'<p>Veganism is a non-action. In other words, you don&#8217;t need to actively do anything to be vegan, so it doesn&#8217;t take more of your time. As such, you can continue to fight for human rights issues or other &#8220;more important&#8221; causes while eating a veggie burger or stir fry instead of a steak. You don&#8217;t need to harm animals while you fight against human oppression. Plus, if we wait until all human rights issues are solved before addressing animal suffering, we would never get there since there will always be human conflict.</p><p>It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, <a href="http://www.animalequality.net/food">56 billion land animals</a> are killed every year for food. <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/">Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon deforestation</a>. Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and severity as non-human animals are. If they were, there would be a global uproar and the issue would be solved immediately.</p><p>Animal abuse is interlinked with human suffering, too. High meat and dairy diets are responsible for some of the United States&#8217; leading killers, like heart disease and strokes. In areas where slaughterhouses are set up, the <a href="http://www.animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf">rates of domestic violence and crime go up</a>. Many human rights violations occur in factory farms because of the high production rate required to meet the demand for meat. <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/No_Relief_Embargo.pdf">Some US factory farm workers wear diapers to work because of lack of bathroom breaks</a>.

	argument: "Plants feel pain",
	tldr: "",
	answer :'<p>If you&#8217;re really serious about this and no amount of scientific evidence will sway you, then it comes down to numbers. If a blade of grass is of the same moral value to you as a dog, pig or chicken, then it makes no sense to feed livestock on with plants, and then kill the animals to eat. This would result in far more plant and animal casualties than if you ate plants directly. If you truly care about plants not feeling pain, it is better to minimise those plant deaths by feeding yourself on them, rather than feeding many more plants to animals.</p><p>But let&#8217;s be reasonable. Plants lack brains, a Central Nervous System, and anything else that neuroscientists know to cause sentience. Some studies show plants to have input / output reactions to certain stimulation, but no study suggests sentience or an ability to feel emotions or pain. You can clearly understand the difference between a blade of grass and a pig. Comparisons between the two are completely absurd.</p>'

	argument: "Animals die in crop harvesting",
	tldr: "",
	answer :'<p>This is true, and no vegan claims to cause no harm to animals. Vegans try to avoid animal deaths with practical solutions i.e. boycotting these industries. But an argument against veganism that uses this fact is an argument several times stronger against eating meat. Why? Because you require about 10 times more crops to feed 56 billion farmed animals per year than if 7 billion humans ate the crops directly. So if you&#8217;re truly concerned with minimising animal deaths from crop harvesting, you should be vegan. That way you minimise the torture and abuse in the meat, dairy and egg industries and you also minimise the accidental deaths in crop harvesting.</p><p>You might argue that we could eat exclusively grass-fed animals who do not require grain, but this is impractical. Firstly, most &#8220;grass-fed&#8221; animals are not fed 100% grass anyway, and secondly, it&#8217;s not sustainable at all to try to feed 7 billion people exclusively on grass-fed beef. There isn&#8217;t the space available for such a thing, and good luck living exclusively off beef and nothing else.</p>'

	answer :'<p>The definition of veganism is: <em>&#8220;Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose&#8221;</em>.</p><p>It is not practicable and possible to die or get ill because you don&#8217;t take a medication you need. It is the law in the US, the UK and Europe that all medicine must be tested on animals before being released to the market, so as vegans we cannot practically avoid this since there aren&#8217;t any non-tested medicines.</p><p>But this is entirely different to eating meat, dairy and eggs for pleasure and convenience when there are thousands of other options available in the supermarket, many times in the next shelf. If the option is between dying or taking medicine tested on animals, you take the medicine. You&#8217;re not in this situation when you buy animal products and this argument is a complete cop-out. Also it is worth mentioning that buying the medicine is not actually increasing demand for animal testing, since the medicine was tested before entering the market and never again, whereas animal products require animal deaths every time.</p>'

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet">United Nations</a> has been urging for years that people move to a plant-based diet because &#8220;lesser consumption of animal products is necessary to save the world from the worst impacts of climate change&#8221;. This is because <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data">animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions, about 18%, than all the transport systems combined in the world, around 13%</a>. It is also the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones and several other environmental degradation indicators.

	answer :'<p>Protein is an incredibly bio-available nutrient. You can get all the protein you want from plant sources without the adverse health effects of eating meat, dairy and eggs (cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, stroke, etc). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/">largest study ever done</a> on vegan nutrient profiles show vegans on average get almost the same amount of protein as non-vegans without supplementation (see Figure 1 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/figure/F1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). This is because all plant foods contain protein and when you eat enough calories of a variety of these you easily meet all your protein needs. Protein deficiency is only seen in subjects with chronic under-eating. Even then, it is more likely that you die of fat deficiency than protein deficiency in a state of starvation.</p><p>If you eat 2000 calories of pure white rice, you&#8217;ll get <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/4766327">41 grams of protein</a>. This is already the recommended daily intake for sedentary women that eat 2000 calories per day.

Indeed, there are cultures who never had cow&#8217;s milk, and there isn&#8217;t a wave of osteoporosis. Cow&#8217;s milk production requires domestication of animals, so by definition could only be achieved relatively recently in human history. Prior to that, did we all have osteoporosis?</p><p>Milk is not for adults. Mammals consume it during infancy, and after the weaning process, adult mammals do not require their mother&#8217;s milk. If we really needed milk, don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d keep on drinking it from our mothers? If that sounds weird, consider that you&#8217;re drinking milk from someone else&#8217;s mother, and not even from your own species.</p><p>Good vegan sources of calcium include: dried herbs, sesame seeds, figs, tofu, almonds, flax seeds, Brazil nuts and kale.

In addition, a B12 supplement is <a href="http://eerainuh.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/vitamin_b12_deficiency.pdf">injected into livestock</a> before slaughter to keep their levels up due to soil being too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients.</p><p>So the question becomes: would you rather take a B12 supplement yourself and be vegan, or supplement animals with B12, and then kill them to obtain B12?
