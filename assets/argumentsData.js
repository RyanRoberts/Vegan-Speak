		tldr : "Yes. And they don't have gender equality nor democracy. Animals are not good ethical role models.",
		answer : "Yes, this is true. But we should not base our ethics as a society on what animals do in nature. Lions eat their offsprings if they don’t have enough food, engage in violent territorial disputes and forcibly impregnate females. Dogs smell each others’ backside when they first meet. Many animals even kill members of their own species. If you say that animals doing something is a justification for us doing it, then by this logic you could advocate murder, infanticide, rape and several other unethical and/or disgusting behaviour that you don’t engage in. Another crucial point is that animals in nature kill to survive. We don’t need to eat other animals to survive, and doing so causes suffering, so if we can avoid it, we should. Animals are not good ethical role models."

This <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/51/20617">study</a> by the National Academy of Sciences of the United States concluded that &#8220;humans are similar to anchovy or pigs and cannot be considered apex predators&#8221;. This means that everyone that uses the &#8220;circle of life&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8217;re at the top of the food chain&#8221; argument should be fine with being violently eaten by other animals higher in the food chain like lions or bears. In fact, they should be fine with having the same treatment as pigs since we are at their same level.</p>'

		argument : "Eating animals is necessary",
		tldr : "optional",
		answer : "It’s not. There are millions of vegans from all paths of life and in all circumstances that follow a vegan diet. In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the United States’ largest organisation of food and nutrition professionals, states the following: \“It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity.\” The largest study ever done on vegan nutrient profiles states the following\: \“In strict vegetarians low dietary intakes of vitamin B12 and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to iron and zinc, have often been of concern 25. In the present study, mean intakes of these nutrients were above minimum requirements 26 in strict vegetarians.\” So eating animal products is not necessary for health and well-being."
