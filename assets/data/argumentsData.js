Lions eat their offsprings if they don\'t have enough food, engage in violent territorial disputes and forcibly impregnate females. Dogs smell each others\' backside when they first meet. Many animals even kill <a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/do-animals-murder-their-own-species">members of their own species</a>. If you say that animals doing something is a justification for us doing it, then by this logic you could advocate murder, infanticide, rape and several other unethical and/or disgusting behaviour that you don\'t engage in.</p><p>Another crucial point is that animals in nature kill to survive. We don\'t need to eat other animals to survive, and doing so causes suffering, so if we can avoid it, we should. Animals are not good ethical role models.</p>'

These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage.

	answer :'<p>It doesn\'t matter if it is, because something being natural doesn\'t mean it\'s ethical or good. This is an \“appeal to nature fallacy\”. You don\'t do things solely because they\'re natural. You use planes, cars, medicine, operations, doors, buildings, clothing, cutlery, cups, and an array of things that are not natural. There are other natural things you avoid, such as killing members of your own species and forcibly impregnating females, because nature is a violent place. Some diseases and health problems are natural, but you do whatever you can to unnaturally get better.</p><p>Our civilisation is based largely on focusing on reducing suffering rather than in staying aligned with nature. In many cases, we strive to avoid the perils of nature. You should do what\'s ethical, not what is natural.

	answer :'<p>There is still a debate about whether or not we are omnivores. There is a lot of evidence pointing towards humans being herbivores, or at least scavengers (like rats, who eat their meat after it has been killed by other predators). This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312295/">article</a> by William C. Roberts, MD argues humans are plant eaters because only herbivores develop atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). I personally think vegans are omnivores just because we can digest meat, but that our preferred source of fuel is plants. But it doesn\'t matter, because we can be completely healthy as vegans, and eating meat causes harm to animals, so we shouldn\'t do it.</p><p>Having the ability to do something doesn\'t mean it\'s right to do so. Human beings can carry out many atrocities, and some do, but those that do face punishment because their actions are wrong.

	answer :'<p>It doesn\'t matter if it did, because we live in a very different world and different things today will make us evolve other than eating meat. Also, that something helped us evolve doesn\'t mean that such behaviour is ethical or acceptable today. Early homo sapiens used rape as a strategy for gene-promotion when they could not get access to consensual sex. This helped the human species evolve to where we are today, but I don\'t see anyone justifying rape because it might have helped us evolve.</p><p>In addition, most scientists agree that it wasn\'t meat, but <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist">cooking foods, that made our brains evolve</a>. This would explain why we\'re the smartest animals and the only animals that cook, while other more carnivorous animals like cats are less intelligent than us. The hypothesis is that cooking allowed humans to get more energy from the same amount of food, and to spend less time chewing, which meant this extra energy helped fuel brain growth.</p>'

Many meat eaters live long and healthy lives.

They suffer all kinds of health problems because they are bred to be much bigger than their natural ancestors. Continuing to breed them serves no purpose, even if everybody was vegan there would be no logical reason to keep breeding these animals, knowing they will suffer health problems due to the manner of their selective breeding.</p><p>But if we really wanted to keep pigs, chickens, cows and the animals we eat alive, we can conserve them in the same way endangered species are, i.e. <strong>not</strong> by slitting their throats.

If the demand for animal products decreases, the number of animals brought into existence will decrease too.

You can\'t do that because those animals are domesticated, and are not natural breeds, they were selectively bred. So it would be releasing billions of animals into ecosystems which would cause so many unknown problems. What vegans want is for animals to stop being bred.

Altruism often results in something positive in return, and bad actions usually result in negativity. If a dog doesn\'t kill other dogs, you\'re less likely to be killed by a dog.</p><p>But regardless, animals aren\'t morally valuable because of their ability to understand morality, they\'re valuable because of their sentience (ability to experience pain and pleasure).

If an animal would like to eat me if they could, does that mean I should base my morality on less intelligent animals and eat other animals too?

	answer :'<p>In some ways, yes. We\'re superior in intelligence. We\'re not superior in our ability to fly or see in the dark. But remember that some humans are superior to other humans in similar ways to animals. Some humans are smarter, faster, stronger, better looking and so on. By this logic, the \“superior\” humans could in theory abuse and kill the inferior humans. This is why the \“might makes right\” argument is a logical fallacy; it can justify several unethical behaviours and the measure of \“superiority\” is completely arbitrary.</p><p>Superiority doesn\'t grant you a right to abuse other sentient beings. In fact, this line of thinking is what justified many atrocities in the past, like The Holocaust, black segregation, disenfranchisement of women, and so on. \“They\'re less than us, so they can be killed or their rights can be taken away\”. Of course, nobody wants animals to have the same rights as humans, like the right to vote, because it doesn\'t make sense.

	argument: "The dairy industry doesn\'t harm animals",
	tldr: "This is factually false.",
	answer :'<p>Cows in the dairy industry, arguably, live more miserable lives than cows raised for meat. This is because they are continuously abused throughout their lives for their milk, and then<strong> </strong>killed. This is how the dairy industry works:</p><p>Since cows only produce milk when they\'re pregnant, the process begins with forced artificial insemination of cows. The farmers insert their arms into the sexual orifice of the cows and pump bull semen into them to impregnate them. This is a necessary step for milk production and occurs in small family farms all the way to factory farms.</p><p>Once the cow has a baby, two things may happen. If the baby is male, then he is no use for the farmers since he will never produce milk. Therefore, the baby is either <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2152608/Baby-calves-shot-C4-documentary-People-right-complain-dont-inform-food.html">killed at the farm</a>, or sold to the veal industry for meat. If the baby is female, then she will have the same future as her mother and will go through several cycles of emotional and physical abuse. In both cases, the mother is not allowed to stay too long with her baby, and cows tend to cry for days after their baby is stolen.</p><p>After about two or three milking cycles, the cow\'s milk production becomes unprofitable, so the cow is killed. At this stage the cow is usually six years old. The natural lifespan of a cow is around twenty years.</p><p>This video summarises the dairy industry: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI">Dairy Is Scary</a>.</p>'

	tldr: "Did you notice only females lay eggs? What happens to males?",
	answer :'<p>In the egg industry, only females are required since only they lay eggs. So at the hatcheries, male and female chicks are separated by workers called \“sexers\”.</p><p>Males are considered useless so they are killed at the hatchery, either by being macerated alive, or by being gassed, drowned, or suffocated in a sack. Females are painfully de-beaked and sent off to the farm, where they will lay a painful 300+ eggs per year due to genetic manipulation (as opposed to a wild chickens 20 or so per year). This process happens in any farm, regardless of it being free-range, organic or whatever.</p><p>After the egg-laying hens stop producing a profitable amount of eggs, they are sent to slaughter, which involves being thrown into an electric bath to be ineffectively stunned, then hoisted up upside down and going along a conveyor belt to have her throat slit. Many chickens will remain fully conscious after their throats are slit and will be boiled alive in the de-feathering tank afterwards. Their slaughter happens at around two years of age. The natural lifespan of a chicken is eight years.</p>'

	answer :'<p>As consumers, we aren\'t responsible for keeping all industries in business. When you go to the supermarket, you don\'t buy every single product they sell to make sure nobody goes out of business. As consumers we choose where our money goes and we pay for the products and services we want to see more of, and we don\'t buy those we dislike. We all understand this, which is why when someone quits smoking or drinking alcohol, people don\'t tell them they\'re putting people in the tobacco and alcohol industries out of jobs.</p><p>However, it is important to realise that jobs aren\'t lost, only displaced. If you\'re not buying milk, therefore funding the dairy industry, you\'re buying soy milk, therefore creating jobs in that industry. While it is true that dairy farmers will have a tough time, for example, it is also true that there is a growing demand for other crops like rice, soy and oats which is putting more people into jobs in those industries, which is only for the best.</p>'

	answer :'<p>Less than 200 years ago, slavery was legal in the United States.</p><p>The laws in place to \“protect\” farmed animals still allow significant harm to be inflicted to these animals. Organisations like the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) claim to work to prevent unnecessary harm to animals. But since eating animal products is unnecessary, isn\'t <strong>all</strong> the harm caused in the meat, dairy and egg industries unnecessary?</p><p>This is an excerpt of what the <a href="https://www.hsa.org.uk/methods/external-trauma">Humane Slaughter Association</a> deems a \“humane\” way to kill an animal:</p><p><em>\“Infant lambs, kids and piglets can be humanely killed by delivering a heavy blow to the head. This must only be used if no other method is immediately available.</em></p><ol><li><em>Hold the animal by the back legs and deliver a firm blow to the back of the head with a blunt instrument, e.g. an iron bar or hammer.</em></li><li><em>Hold the animal by the back legs and swing it through an arc to hit the back of its head with considerable force against a solid object, e.g. a brick wall or metal stanchion.</em></li></ol><p><em>With both methods it is essential that the blow is delivered swiftly, firmly and with absolute determination. If there is any doubt that the animal has not been killed effectively, the blow should be immediately repeated.\”</em></p><p>You can clearly see that there is nothing humane about the way we treat and kill animals. In UK law, chickens can still be debeaked, pigs and male calves can be castrated, pigs can have their teeth pulled out, and more.

	tldr: "If I say it is wrong to murder people, but I murder people myself, that doesn\'t make murdering people right",
	answer :'<p>The fact that I have a computer made with components that were produced in sweatshops but am vegan is no different than you having one and being against human slavery or racism. Having a laptop does not invalidate the ideologies of gender/race equality, in the same way it does not invalidate veganism. The fact that anybody funds sweat shops doesn’t mean you must also pay for animal abuse.</<p>You buying animal products is not helping workers in unfair conditions. So being vegan and buying from sweatshops is still better than not being vegan and doing so. If you\'re interested in buying fair-trade, there are several companies that pay their employees decent living wages, and you can buy from them. The logical conclusion is that if you\'re against slave labour you\'re against all oppression, including animal oppression, so you should be vegan.</<p>Trying to invalidate veganism by telling a vegan that they also contribute to harm because them buy sweatshop products is a form of the \“al tu quoque\” fallacy. If I say it is wrong to kill animals for food, but I cause harm elsewhere by buying from sweatshops, that doesn\'t make killing animals right.

If a vegan says \“it is wrong to mutilate pigs\”, the argument tries to say \“well you step on ants and use cars with tyres that have animal products, so who are you to speak?\” This argument tries to invalidate veganism by suggesting that there is no difference between a vegan contributing 1% to animal abuse and a meat-eater contributing 100%.</<p>The reality is that boycotting the meat, dairy, egg, wool, silk, fur, and leather industries alone already account for 99% of all animal abuse. In our modern world, where it is impossible to live a life without coming into contact with some sort of animal product or by-product, the fastest and most practical way to end animal abuse is by boycotting the big producers of animal abuse.

	answer :'<p>If I kill you, or your dog or a friend, by your logic this wouldn\'t be unethical because in my subjective view of morality killing isn\'t wrong. Morality must be based in facts and reason, it can\'t be completely arbitrary, or else anyone can justify an atrocity by saying their morality is subjective. We must have at least some objective measurements of what is and isn\'t ethical. Agreeing that killing beings for pleasure or convenience isn\'t ethical is a good place to start to prevent violence towards humans and animals. Veganism follows from this.</p><p>Even if you believe morality is subjective, I think most people would agree that animals have some moral value, and that they shouldn\'t be harmed for no reason. So by your own subjective morality you can agree that veganism is right because harming animals unnecessarily is wrong.</p>'

	answer :'<p>You can continue to fight for human rights issues or other \“more important\” causes while eating a veggie burger or stir fry instead of a steak. You don\'t need to harm animals while you fight against human oppression. Plus, if we wait until all human rights issues are solved before addressing animal suffering, we would never get there since there will always be human conflict.</p><p>It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, <a href="http://www.animalequality.net/food">56 billion land animals</a> are killed every year for food. <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/">Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon deforestation</a>. Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and severity as non-human animals are. If they were, there would be a global uproar and the issue would be solved immediately.</p><p>Animal abuse is interlinked with human suffering, too. High meat and dairy diets are responsible for some of the United States\' leading killers, like heart disease and strokes. In areas where slaughterhouses are set up, the <a href="http://www.animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf">rates of domestic violence and crime go up</a>. Many human rights violations occur in factory farms because of the high production rate required to meet the demand for meat. <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/No_Relief_Embargo.pdf">Some US factory farm workers wear diapers to work because of lack of bathroom breaks</a>.

	tldr: "",
	answer :'<p>If you\'re really serious about this and no amount of scientific evidence will sway you, then it comes down to numbers. If a blade of grass is of the same moral value to you as a dog, pig or chicken, then it makes no sense to feed livestock on with plants, and then kill the animals to eat. This would result in far more plant and animal casualties than if you ate plants directly. If you truly care about plants not feeling pain, it is better to minimise those plant deaths by feeding yourself on them, rather than feeding many more plants to animals.</p><p>But let\'s be reasonable. Plants lack brains, a Central Nervous System, and anything else that neuroscientists know to cause sentience. Some studies show plants to have input / output reactions to certain stimulation, but no study suggests sentience or an ability to feel emotions or pain. You can clearly understand the difference between a blade of grass and a pig. Comparisons between the two are completely absurd.</p>'

	argument: "Animals die in crop harvesting",
	tldr: "",
	answer :'<p>This is true, and no vegan claims to cause no harm to animals. Vegans try to avoid animal deaths with practical solutions i.e. boycotting these industries. But an argument against veganism that uses this fact is an argument several times stronger against eating meat. Why? Because you require about 10 times more crops to feed 56 billion farmed animals per year than if 7 billion humans ate the crops directly. So if you\'re truly concerned with minimising animal deaths from crop harvesting, you should be vegan. That way you minimise the torture and abuse in the meat, dairy and egg industries and you also minimise the accidental deaths in crop harvesting.</p><p>You might argue that we could eat exclusively grass-fed animals who do not require grain, but this is impractical. Firstly, most \“grass-fed\” animals are not fed 100% grass anyway, and secondly, it\'s not sustainable at all to try to feed 7 billion people exclusively on grass-fed beef. There isn\'t the space available for such a thing, and good luck living exclusively off beef and nothing else.</p>'

It is the law in the US, the UK and Europe that all medicine must be tested on animals before being released to the market, so as vegans we cannot practically avoid this since there aren\'t any non-tested medicines.</p><p>But this is entirely different to eating meat, dairy and eggs for pleasure and convenience when there are thousands of other options available in the supermarket, many times in the next shelf. If the option is between dying or taking medicine tested on animals, you take the medicine. You\'re not in this situation when you buy animal products and this argument is a complete cop-out. Also it is worth mentioning that buying the medicine is not actually increasing demand for animal testing, since the medicine was tested before entering the market and never again, whereas animal products require animal deaths every time.</p>'

	answer :'<p>Protein is an incredibly bio-available nutrient. You can get all the protein you want from plant sources without the adverse health effects of eating meat, dairy and eggs (cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, stroke, etc). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/">largest study ever done</a> on vegan nutrient profiles show vegans on average get almost the same amount of protein as non-vegans without supplementation (see Figure 1 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/figure/F1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). This is because all plant foods contain protein and when you eat enough calories of a variety of these you easily meet all your protein needs. Protein deficiency is only seen in subjects with chronic under-eating. Even then, it is more likely that you die of fat deficiency than protein deficiency in a state of starvation.</p><p>If you eat 2000 calories of pure white rice, you\'ll get <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/4766327">41 grams of protein</a>. This is already the recommended daily intake for sedentary women that eat 2000 calories per day.

Cow\'s milk production requires domestication of animals, so by definition could only be achieved relatively recently in human history. Prior to that, did we all have osteoporosis?</p><p>Milk is not for adults. Mammals consume it during infancy, and after the weaning process, adult mammals do not require their mother\'s milk. If we really needed milk, don\'t you think we\'d keep on drinking it from our mothers? If that sounds weird, consider that you\'re drinking milk from someone else\'s mother, and not even from your own species.</p><p>Good vegan sources of calcium include: dried herbs, sesame seeds, figs, tofu, almonds, flax seeds, Brazil nuts and kale. Most vegan milks are fortified with calcium, so you could just consume those as you would do any cow milk.</p>'

Vegans generally have a better intake of vitamin C than meat-eaters, which aids iron absorption. The type of iron found in meat (heme-iron) is the type your body cannot regulate properly, and forces its way into the bloodstream.

So B12 isn\'t exclusive to animal products.</p><p>Vegans have to supplement B12 by an oral supplement or by eating fortified foods, but this doesn\'t invalidate veganism. If the argument is \“you can\'t get B12 naturally as a vegan, therefore veganism is bad\”, then this is a logical fallacy called \“<i>appeal to nature</i>\“. Not only this, but 99% of people that live in modern society supplement in one way or another.</p><p>The bread you eat is fortified with vitamins, juices are fortified, cows milk has vitamins added to it during the manufacturing process, table salt often has iodine added to it and breakfast cereals are fortified. All these foods are fortified because the vast majority of people (i.e. non-vegans) fail to get adequate nutrition without them. In addition, a B12 supplement is <a href="http://eerainuh.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/vitamin_b12_deficiency.pdf">injected into livestock</a> before slaughter to keep their levels up due to soil being too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients.</p><p>So the question becomes: would you rather take a B12 supplement yourself and be vegan, or supplement animals with B12, and then kill them to obtain B12?
